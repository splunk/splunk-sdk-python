[countmatches-command]
syntax = countmatches fieldname=<field> pattern=<regular_expression> \
    <field-list>
alias =
shortdesc = Counts the number of non-overlapping matches to a regular \
    expression in a search result.
description = A count of the number of non-overlapping matches to the regular \
    expression specified by pattern is computed for each record processed.
    The result is stored in the field specified by fieldname. If fieldname \
    exists, its value is replaced. If fieldname does not exist, it is \
    created. Results are otherwise passed through to the next pipeline \
    processor unmodified.
comment1 = Count the number of words in the text of each tweet in tweets.csv \
    and put the result in word_count.
example1 = | inputcsv tweets.csv | countmatches fieldname=word_count \
    pattern="\\w+" text

[simulate-command]
syntax = simulate csv=<path> rate=<expected_event_count> \
    interval=<sampling_period> duration=<execution_period> (seed=<string>)?
alias =
shortdesc = Generates a sequence of events drawn from a csv file using \
    repeated random sampling.
description = The simulate command uses repeated random samples of the event \
    records in csv for the execution period of duration. Sample sizes are \
    determined for each time interval in duration using a Poisson distribution \
    with an average rate specifying the expected event count during interval.
comment1 = Generate events drawn by repeated random sampling of events in \
    tweets.csv.
example1 = | simulate csv=population.csv rate=50 interval=00:00:01 \
    duration=00:00:05

[sum-command]
syntax = sum total=<field> <field-list>
alias =
shortdesc = Computes the sum of a set of fields.
description = The total produced is sum(sum(fieldname, 1, n), 1, N) where n = \
    number of fields, N = number of records.
comment1 = This example computes the total linecount in the first 200 records \
    in the _internal index.
example1 = index = _internal | head 200 | sum total=lines linecount

description = This command creates a specified number of dummy events.
comment1 = This example generates 5 events
