class CountMatchesCommand(StreamingCommand):
    """ Counts the number of non-overlapping matches to a regular expression in a set of fields.

    ##Syntax

    .. code-block::
        countmatches fieldname=<field> pattern=<regular_expression> <field-list>

    ##Description

    A count of the number of non-overlapping matches to the regular expression specified by `pattern` is computed for
    each record processed. The result is stored in the field specified by `fieldname`. If `fieldname` exists, its value
    is replaced. If `fieldname` does not exist, it is created. Event records are otherwise passed through to the next
    pipeline processor unmodified.

    ##Example

    Count the number of words in the `text` of each tweet in tweets.csv and store the result in `word_count`.

    .. code-block::
        | inputlookup tweets | countmatches fieldname=word_count pattern="\\w+" text

    """

        **Syntax:** **fieldname=***<fieldname>*
        **Description:** Name of the field that will hold the match count''',
        require=True, validate=validators.Fieldname())

    pattern = Option(
        doc='''
        **Syntax:** **pattern=***<regular-expression>*
        **Description:** Regular expression pattern to match''',
        require=True, validate=validators.RegularExpression())
