class FilterCommand(EventingCommand):
    """ Filters, augments, and updates records on the events stream.

    ##Syntax

    .. code-block::
        filter predicate=<expression> update=<statements>

    ##Description

    The :code:`filter` command filters records from the events stream returning only those for which the
    :code:`predicate` is true after applying :code:`update` statements. If no :code:`predicate` is specified, all
    records are returned. If no :code:`update` is specified, records are returned unmodified.

    The :code:`predicate` and :code:`update` operations execute in a restricted scope that includes the standard Python
    built-in module and the current record. Within this scope fields are accessible by name as local variables.

    ##Example

    Excludes odd-numbered records and replaces all occurrences of "world" with "Splunk" in the _raw field produced by
    the :code:`generatetext` command.

    .. code-block::
        | generatetext text="Hello world! How the heck are you?" count=6
        | filter predicate="(long(_serial) & 1) == 0" update="_raw = _raw.replace('world', 'Splunk')"
