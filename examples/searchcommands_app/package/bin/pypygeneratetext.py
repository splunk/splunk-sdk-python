# Requirements:
# 1. PyPy is on splunkd's path.
#   Ensure this by performing these operating system-dependent tasks:
#
#   CentOS
#   ------
#   Create or update /etc/sysconfig/splunk with a line that looks like this:
#
#      1 PATH=$PATH:/opt/pypy/bin
#
#   P1 [ ] TODO: Verify that the instructions for putting PyPy on Splunk's PATH on CentOS work
#
#   OS X
#   ----
#   Edit /Library/LaunchAgents/com.splunk.plist and ensure that it looks like this:
#
#      1 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
#      2 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">

#     20     </dict>
#     21 </dict>
#     22 </plist>
#
#   Note lines 16-20 which extend PATH to include /opt/local/bin, the directory that the pypy executable is typically
#   placed.
#
#   Windows
#   -------
#   Ensure that pypy.exe is on the system-wide Path environment variable.
